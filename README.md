# MidTerm-Project
this is a documentation of my sanity during this project
this will be prescriped based on dates when i have touched the project and wrote something

disclaimer: if something in the code looks like it shouldn't work. i probably figured how it works. but then when the project is done.. there will be only god that knows how it works.

good luck to me! (9th nov 2025)

i have made the nav for the website. i want to make the Logo and the nav simple and fixed to the screen. one way to find out when its complete. but for some reason the flex does not wanna work. i wanna move the navs to the right and the logo to the left.. they are all moving together AAAAAHHH
